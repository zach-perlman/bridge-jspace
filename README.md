# bridge-jspace

**Question.** In a two-hop question ("the language spoken in the country where the Amazon River ends is ..."), the
model has to compute a bridge entity (Brazil) before it can answer (Portuguese). On Qwen3.6-27B and Gemma 4 31B the
J-lens often cannot read that bridge. Does the bridge still act on the answer through the J-space, or through a part
of the representation the J-lens cannot read?

**Reference result (Claude, Gurnee et al. 2026,
[Verbalizable Representations Form a Global Workspace](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2026/workspace/index.html)).**
Swapping the bridge's probe for another entity's flips the answer in 61% of items when only the J-space part of the
probe is swapped, 28% for the remainder, and 6% for the remainder when the J-space coordinates are clamped.

**Reading.** If on open models the remainder flips about as often as the J-space part and survives the clamp, the
bridge works outside the workspace. If the numbers look like Claude's, the J-lens misses on open models are a read-site
or tokenization artifact.

## Method
1. `data/entity_prompts.json`: about 8 prompts per entity that imply the entity without naming it, for the 97
   entities in `data/probe_swap.json` (bridges and swap targets). Qwen keeps the ones it answers correctly.
2. Probe per entity and layer: mean final-token residual over its kept prompts minus the mean over all entities.
3. Decomposition per layer: non-negative OMP (k=25) over J-lens token directions gives the J-space part; the remainder
   is the rest.
4. Swaps on the 90 two-hop items, at every band layer and prompt position, under five conditions: raw J-lens vectors,
   full probe, J-space part, remainder, remainder with the J-space coordinates clamped. Each has a random-direction
   control of the same edit norm. Metric: rate at which the swap answer becomes the top word, with Wilson 95% CIs.

## Layout
- `src/bridge_jspace/`: model and lens loading, OMP, the coordinate clamp, statistics.
- `scripts/expNN_*.py`: one script per experiment; `results/expNN_*/` holds the manifest and outputs.
- `AGENTS.md`: rules for running experiments. `VERIFIED.md`: results a human has checked.

## Running
```bash
/venv/main/bin/python tests/test_core.py        # toy-tensor tests (no GPU)
/venv/main/bin/python scripts/exp01_probes.py --help
```

## Status
See the STATE block in `AGENTS.md`. Nothing is verified yet.
